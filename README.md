# HAGrowRoom
My HA controller for veg and flower rooms
I will do my best to keep this updated as I change, add and improve. 
System heavily uses custom template sensors for yes no values to compair sensors to input helpers for yes no values in automations. 
I found these were more reliable than using numeric states as they woudl hang for some reason or another on me. 
Make sure to visit custom addons and www folders for the intergrations needed. I will add links to the git hubs of the ones I used at a alter date. 
Heavy used of ESPHOME and zigbee.
